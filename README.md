# voc_fcn
Fully Convolutional Network trained on Pascal Visual Object Classes dataset

Implementation of "Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation" paper.

This project is a work in progress.
Important missing features:
- data augmentation
- batch training
- logging predictions while training
- predictions analysis beyond validation loss
- COCO-dataset style segmentations plots
